# Image-Denoising
Image denoising using commonly used filters (Gaussian, Median, Perona-Malik, Bilateral, NLM, BM3D) and Wiener filtering

## Task 1: Denoising with tradiitonal and commonly used filters
For this part, Gaussian, Median, Perona-Malik, Bilateral, NLM and BM3D filters are used.

## Task 2: Denoising with adaptive and non-adaptive Wiener filtering
Denoising is performed with IIR Wiener filter and adaptive FIR Wiener filter. The results are compared both quantitatively (PSNR and SSIM) and qualitatively.
